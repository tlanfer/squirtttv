# SquirtTTV

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/tlanfer/squirtttv?include_prereleases=&sort=semver&color=blue)](https://github.com/tlanfer/squirtttv/releases)

## Update 20.07.2025

Added a new feature: You can now react to chat messages that contain a specific text.

## Update 07.07.2024

Brand new version, comes with a fancy little UI to make setup easier. No more fiddling with yaml files ðŸŽ‰
Almost the whole companion app has been rewritten. Its probably riddled with bugs. But it worked on a quick test.

What changed:

* WebUI: Right click the tray icon and select settings to open the settings UI.
  * See on the web ui if your integrations are connected
* Multiple devices:
  * You can now configure any number of devices and use them at the same time
  * You can use different devices for different alerts, multiple at the same time, or randomize between them

## Update 21.04.2024

I ported this to run on an esp32 c2. Works great so far, but might not be compatible with other controllers.

I also added an "is this really a squirter?" detection to the mDNS auto discovery stuff.
That means old squirters wont be detected unless you set "legacy: true" in the config file.

## What is this

This lets you squirt someone with water when something happens on twitch.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference)

## Building the hardware

1. Wire up an ESP8266 so that pin D6 triggers the water pistol

   * Start with a "Gloria AutoPump Mini" electronic water sprayer
   * Remove the original micro switch from the trigger
   * Replace the micro switch with a mosfet, or some other way for GPIO 12 to trigger the pump.
   * A neat solution is using a Wemos D1 mini and a mosfet shield for it

2. Install the firmware on it using Arduino
3. On the first start, the device will open up a wifi access point
4. Use your phone to connect to the wifi AP, then give the device your home wifi credentials.After you save, it should reboot and be available on your network
5. Go to `http://<device-ip>/edit` to upload the web ui from the `firmware/ui/` folder

I'm sure this will work with other electric sprayers as well, but i only tested it with the Gloria AutoPump Mini.

## Preparing the hardware

1. Plug the USB device into power
2. If you just built the device and followed the previous section, you can skip the following steps
3. On the first start, the device will open up a wifi access point
5. Use your phone to connect to the wifi AP, then give the device your home wifi credentials
6. After you save, it should reboot and be available on your network 

## Preparing the companion

1. [Go here](/releases/tag/latest) and download the latest `companion.exe`
2. Run the executable once. It will create an example config file named `config.example.yaml`
3. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
4. Customize the config to your liking (see the [configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for details)

> âš  Note that the configuration file uses YAML formatting.
>   Verify the configuration dump after launching the app and if it doesn't match what you expect, check if you 
>   got your indentation right.

## Usage

In this order:
1. Put batteries in your sprayer
2. Plug the USB device into power
3. Start the companion app

The companion should automatically find your sprayers on the network.
You can go to `http://<your-sprayers-ip>/` to send test sprays to experiment with duration.
